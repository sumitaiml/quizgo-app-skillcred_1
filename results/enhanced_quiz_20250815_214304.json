        "type": "essay",
        "options": [],
        "correct_answer": "A complete answer should include: 1) Definition of coordinating conjunctions with examples (FANBOYS) and their use in joining elements of equal grammatical rank. 2) Definition of subordinating conjunctions with examples and their use in joining a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing the relationship between them. 3) Clear examples of sentences illustrating the use of both types of conjunctions, demonstrating their different functions in sentence structure.  4) Discussion of punctuation rules surrounding each type.",
        "explanation": "The essay should demonstrate a clear understanding of the grammatical functions and applications of both coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, and the difference between them."

        "explanation": "This question tests the understanding of the fundamental difference between the two conjunction types."

        "question": "Provide three examples of sentences using different correlative coordinating conjunctions, explaining the relationship they show between the connected elements.",
        "type": "essay",
        "options": [],
        "correct_answer": "The answer should contain three sentences, each using a different pair of correlative coordinating conjunctions (e.g., not only...but also, either...or, neither...nor).  Each sentence should clearly demonstrate the relationship established by the conjunctions between the connected elements.  The explanation should articulate the function and impact of each chosen pair on the sentence's meaning and structure.",
        "explanation": "The essay should demonstrate the student's ability to correctly use and explain the function of correlative coordinating conjunctions in constructing sentences."
