        "type": "essay",
        "options": [],
        "correct_answer": "A complete answer should include: \n1. Definition of coordinating conjunctions with examples (FANBOYS) and explanation of their use in joining elements of equal grammatical rank.\n2. Definition of subordinating conjunctions with examples (e.g., because, although, while) and explanation of their use in introducing dependent clauses and showing the relationship between clauses of unequal rank.\n3.  Illustrative sentences demonstrating the correct usage of both types of conjunctions.  The answer should show understanding of how each conjunction type affects sentence structure and meaning.",
        "explanation": "The essay should demonstrate a clear understanding of the grammatical functions and differences between coordinating and subordinating conjunctions."

        "correct_answer": "subordinating, coordinating",
        "explanation": "This question tests the understanding of the fundamental difference between the two main types of conjunctions."

        "question": "Provide three different examples of sentences using different types of conjunctions (coordinating, correlative coordinating, and subordinating), explaining the grammatical function of each conjunction used.",
        "type": "essay",
        "options": [],
        "correct_answer": "The essay should include three original sentences, each using a different type of conjunction.  The explanation should correctly identify each conjunction type and explain how it connects the elements within the sentence (grammatical function).  The student should demonstrate accurate usage and understanding of the differences between conjunction types.",
        "explanation": "This question tests the ability to apply knowledge of different conjunction types in constructing grammatically correct sentences."
