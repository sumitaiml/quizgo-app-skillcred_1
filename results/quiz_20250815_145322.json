    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "If an integer array 'numbers' has a size of 10 and the address of numbers[0] is 1000 (in decimal), and each integer occupies 4 bytes, what is the address of numbers[5]?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "options": [
          "A) 1020",
          "B) 1010",
          "C) 1000",
          "D) 1016"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Each integer takes 4 bytes, so numbers[5] will be at 1000 + (5 * 4) = 1020."
      },
      {
        "question": "In a single-dimensional array, accessing an element beyond the declared size leads to undefined behavior.",
        "type": "true_false",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "True",
        "explanation": "Accessing elements outside the array bounds leads to unpredictable results, including crashes or incorrect output."
      },
      {
        "question": "What will be the output of the provided 'Calculate Average' program if the user enters 3, 10, 20, 30 as input?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "options": [
          "A) 15",
          "B) 20",
          "C) 17.5",
          "D) 60"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sum of the numbers (10 + 20 + 30) is 60.  The average is 60/3 = 20. The question states that 3 numbers are to be entered."
      },
      {
        "question": "Consider the array declaration: `int scores[5] = {80, 90, 70, 100, 85};`.  What is the value of scores[2]?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "options": [
          "A) 80",
          "B) 90",
          "C) 70",
          "D) 100"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Array indices start from 0. Therefore, scores[2] refers to the third element in the array, which is 70."
      },
      {
        "question": "An array in C is a homogenous data structure.",
        "type": "true_false",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "True",
        "explanation": "A C array can only hold elements of the same data type.  It cannot store a mix of integers and characters, for example."
