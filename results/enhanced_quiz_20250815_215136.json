        "correct_answer": "A complete answer should include: 1) Definition of coordinating conjunctions with examples (FANBOYS) and illustration of their use in joining elements of equal grammatical rank.  2) Definition of subordinating conjunctions with examples (when, because, although, etc.) and illustration of their use in joining dependent and independent clauses. 3) Clear explanation of how the grammatical function differs between the two types of conjunctions.  4) Examples demonstrating correct punctuation with each type. ",

        "question": "Provide three examples of correlative coordinating conjunctions and construct a sentence using each pair, demonstrating their correct usage.",
        "type": "essay",
        "options": [],
        "correct_answer": "The answer should provide three different pairs of correlative conjunctions (e.g.,  both...and,  either...or, neither...nor) and correctly use each pair in a separate, grammatically correct sentence.  The sentences should clearly demonstrate the paired nature of the conjunctions and the elements they connect.",
        "explanation": "The essay should demonstrate understanding of the function and proper usage of correlative coordinating conjunctions."
