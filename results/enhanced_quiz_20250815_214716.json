B) The sun shone brightly yet the clouds remained. C)  He studied hard, he passed the test. D) She sang beautifully but danced awkwardly and played the piano.",

          "D)"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A correctly uses a comma before the coordinating conjunction 'and' to join two independent clauses. B is correct in its use of the conjunction but could improve by adding a comma. C lacks a conjunction. D uses a comma before the 'and' and 'but' correctly, but should have a comma after 'awkwardly'."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "False",
        "explanation": "Subordinating conjunctions connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, not two independent clauses.  Coordinating conjunctions connect independent clauses."

        "type": "essay",
        "options": [],
        "correct_answer": "A complete answer should include: \n1. Correct punctuation when joining two independent clauses (comma before conjunction).\n2. Absence of commas when joining words or phrases.\n3. Comma usage between items in a series (optional before conjunction).\n4. Examples illustrating each scenario.\n5. Explanation of the exceptions for short independent clauses where a comma may be omitted.",
        "explanation": "The essay requires a deep understanding of comma rules with coordinating conjunctions, demonstrating mastery of grammatical nuances."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "While 'therefore' and 'because' are both conjunctions, they are not correlative conjunctions; they don't function in pairs."

      {
        "question": "Construct two original sentences, one using a subordinating conjunction to show cause and effect, and another using correlative conjunctions to show contrast.",
        "type": "essay",
        "options": [],
        "correct_answer": "The answer should include:\n1. A correctly punctuated sentence using a subordinating conjunction to establish a cause-and-effect relationship (e.g., 'Because it rained, the game was canceled.').\n2. A correctly punctuated sentence utilizing correlative conjunctions to highlight a contrast (e.g., 'Not only was the food delicious, but also the service was exceptional.').",
