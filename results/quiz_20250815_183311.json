    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Which of the following sentences correctly uses a coordinating conjunction to join two independent clauses?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "options": [
          "A) The sun was shining, and the birds were singing.",
          "B) The sun was shining the birds were singing.",
          "C) The sun was shining; the birds were singing.",
          "D) The sun was shining, but the birds were singing and the dog barked."
        ],
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Option A correctly uses the coordinating conjunction 'and' to join two independent clauses, with a comma preceding the conjunction. Options B and C lack proper punctuation. Option D, while grammatically correct, presents an overly complicated example."
      },
      {
        "question": "When joining three or more words with a coordinating conjunction, a comma should always be placed before the conjunction.",
        "type": "true_false",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "False",
        "explanation": "While a comma is typically used between items in a series, it's optional before the final coordinating conjunction.  The provided text illustrates both possibilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "The acronym FANBOYS is used to remember which type of conjunction?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "options": [
          "A) Subordinating Conjunctions",
          "B) Correlative Conjunctions",
          "C) Coordinating Conjunctions",
          "D) Adverbial Conjunctions"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "FANBOYS is a mnemonic device to remember the seven coordinating conjunctions: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So."
      },
      {
        "question": "Identify the correlative conjunction in the following sentence:  'Not only did she study hard, but she also sought help from the Writing Center.'",
        "type": "mcq",
        "options": [
          "A) only...but",
          "B) Not only...but also",
          "C) did...sought",
          "D) hard...help"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Not only...but also' is a pair of correlative conjunctions working together to connect two clauses.  The other options are incorrect."
      },
      {
        "question": "The sentence 'Mary wrote her essay, and she submitted it on time' requires a comma before the conjunction 'and'.",
        "type": "true_false",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "True",
        "explanation": "The sentence joins two independent clauses; therefore, a comma is needed before the coordinating conjunction 'and'."
