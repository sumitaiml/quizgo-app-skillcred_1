          "but",
          "or",
          "since",
          "and"
        ],
        "answer": "since",
        "explanation": "FANBOYS (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So) are the coordinating conjunctions.  'Since' is a subordinating conjunction."

        "question": "A comma is always required before a coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses.",

        "answer": "Coordinating conjunctions join words, phrases, or clauses of equal grammatical rank (e.g., independent clauses). Example: Mary went to the store, and John stayed home. Subordinating conjunctions join a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing the relationship between them. Example:  Because it was raining, Mary stayed home.",
        "explanation": "This tests understanding of the core difference and application of the two types of conjunctions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pair is NOT a correlative coordinating conjunction?",

        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "To join more than two words, phrases, or subordinate clauses, use a comma between each section of the series. A comma may or may not be used before the __________ conjunction.",
