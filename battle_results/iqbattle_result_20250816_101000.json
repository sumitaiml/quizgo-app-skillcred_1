      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a coordinating conjunction?",
        "options": [
          "but",
          "or",
          "because",
          "and"
        ],
        "answer": "because",
        "explanation": "FANBOYS (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) are the coordinating conjunctions.  'Because' is a subordinating conjunction."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "A comma is always required before a coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "While generally true, the document states that the comma may be omitted if the independent clauses are very short."
      },
      {
        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "The acronym _______ is used to remember the coordinating conjunctions.",
        "answer": "FANBOYS",
        "explanation": "The document explicitly mentions this acronym."
      },
      {
        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Explain the difference between coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, providing at least one example of each and illustrating their function in a sentence.",
        "answer_example": "Coordinating conjunctions connect elements of equal grammatical rank (words, phrases, or independent clauses). Example:  'Mary went to the store, and John stayed home.'  Subordinating conjunctions connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing the relationship between them. Example: 'Because it was raining, Mary stayed home.'",
        "explanation": "This tests understanding beyond simple memorization; it demands comprehension of the grammatical roles and functions of each conjunction type."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pair is NOT a correlative coordinating conjunction?",
        "options": [
          "both...and",
          "either...or",
          "since...then",
          "neither...nor"
        ],
        "answer": "since...then",
        "explanation": "'Since' is a subordinating conjunction, not a correlative coordinating conjunction."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "When joining more than two words with a coordinating conjunction, a comma is always necessary before the conjunction.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "The document states that a comma *may or may not* be used before the conjunction in such cases."
      },
      {
        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "Subordinating conjunctions connect a dependent clause to an _______________ clause.",
        "answer": "independent",
        "explanation": "This directly tests the definition provided in the document."
      },
      {
        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Provide three examples of sentences using different types of conjunctions (coordinating, correlative coordinating, and subordinating) and briefly explain the function of each conjunction in your chosen sentences.",
        "answer_example": "1. Coordinating: 'The sun was shining, and the birds were singing.' ('and' connects two independent clauses). 2. Correlative Coordinating: 'Not only did she study hard, but also she sought help from the Writing Center.' ('Not only...but also' connects two parallel clauses). 3. Subordinating: 'Although it was late, she continued writing.' ('Although' introduces a dependent clause modifying the main clause).",
        "explanation": "Tests application of the knowledge by creating original examples and explaining grammatical roles.  It avoids pure recall."
