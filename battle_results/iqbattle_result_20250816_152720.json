      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a coordinating conjunction?",
        "options": [
          "but",
          "or",
          "since",
          "and"
        ],
        "answer": "since",
        "explanation": "FANBOYS (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So) are the coordinating conjunctions.  'Since' is a subordinating conjunction."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "A comma is always required before a coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "While generally true, a comma may be omitted if the independent clauses are very short."
      },
      {
        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "The conjunctions 'both...and' are an example of _______________ conjunctions.",
        "answer": "correlative coordinating",
        "explanation": "These conjunctions work in pairs to connect elements of equal grammatical rank."
      },
      {
        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Explain the difference between coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, providing at least one example of each and illustrating their function in a sentence.",
        "answer": "Coordinating conjunctions join elements of equal grammatical rank (words, phrases, clauses). Example:  'Mary went to the store, and John stayed home.'  Subordinating conjunctions join a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing the relationship between them. Example: 'Because it was raining, Mary stayed home.' The coordinating conjunction 'and' simply links two independent clauses; the subordinating conjunction 'because' shows the cause-effect relationship between the clauses.",
        "explanation": "A successful answer will accurately define both types, offer clear examples and explain how each conjunction functions within its respective sentence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pair is NOT a correlative coordinating conjunction?",
        "options": [
          "either...or",
          "neither...nor",
          "then...because",
          "both...and"
        ],
        "answer": "then...because",
        "explanation": "'Then...because' doesn't function as a correlative pair.  Correlative conjunctions appear in pairs to connect elements equally."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "When using coordinating conjunctions to join more than two words in a series, commas are optional between each item in the series.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "Commas are required between each item in a series of three or more words, phrases, or clauses, although the comma before the final conjunction is sometimes omitted."
      },
      {
        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "Subordinating conjunctions connect a dependent clause to an _______________ clause.",
        "answer": "independent",
        "explanation": "This is the core function of subordinating conjunctions \u2013 creating a relationship between a dependent and an independent clause."
      },
      {
        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Provide a sentence using a subordinating conjunction that shows a contrast between two actions.  Explain how the conjunction creates this contrast.",
        "answer": "Although the sun was shining, Mary decided to stay inside. The subordinating conjunction 'although' introduces a dependent clause that contradicts the expectation created by the main clause. It shows the unexpected action of Mary staying inside despite the sunshine.",
        "explanation": "The answer should demonstrate understanding of the contrastive function of subordinating conjunctions."
