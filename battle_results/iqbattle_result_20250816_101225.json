      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a coordinating conjunction?",
        "options": [
          "and",
          "but",
          "because",
          "or"
        ],
        "answer": "because",
        "explanation": "Because is a subordinating conjunction, connecting a dependent clause to an independent clause."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "A comma is always required before a coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "A comma is usually required, but it can be omitted if the clauses are very short."
      },

        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "The acronym _______ is used to remember the coordinating conjunctions.",
        "answer": "FANBOYS",
        "explanation": "FANBOYS stands for For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So."
      },
      {
        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Explain the difference between coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, providing at least two examples of each in sentences.",
        "answer": "Coordinating conjunctions join words, phrases, or clauses of equal grammatical rank.  Examples:  'Mary went to the store, and John stayed home.' (joins two independent clauses); 'Apples and oranges are fruits.' (joins two words). Subordinating conjunctions join a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing the relationship between them. Examples: 'Because it was raining, I stayed inside.' (subordinating 'because' introduces the reason); 'If you study hard, you will succeed.' (subordinating 'if' introduces a condition)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pair is NOT a correlative coordinating conjunction?",

          "both...and",
          "neither...nor",
          "then...because",
          "either...or"
        ],
        "answer": "then...because",
        "explanation": "Then...because is not a standard pair of correlative conjunctions.  'Then' is an adverb and 'because' is a subordinating conjunction."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "Subordinating conjunctions connect independent clauses of equal rank.",

        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "When joining more than two items in a series using coordinating conjunctions, a comma should be used between each item, and a comma may or may not be used before the final _________.",
        "answer": "conjunction",
        "explanation": "The document explicitly states this rule."

      {
        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Provide a sentence that uses both a coordinating and a subordinating conjunction.",
        "answer": "I went to the Writing Center, and because I needed help with my essay, I asked for assistance."
