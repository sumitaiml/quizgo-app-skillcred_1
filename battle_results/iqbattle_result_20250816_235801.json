        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Coordinating conjunctions (FANBOYS) are for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. 'Because' is a subordinating conjunction."

        "question": "A comma is ALWAYS required before a coordinating conjunction when:",

        "options": [
          "A) Joining two words",
          "B) Joining two independent clauses",

          "D) Joining two subordinate clauses"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While a comma is often omitted with short independent clauses, it's grammatically correct and generally recommended before a coordinating conjunction linking two independent clauses."
      },

        "question": "What type of conjunction connects a dependent clause to an independent clause?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "options": [
          "A) Coordinating",
          "B) Correlative Coordinating",

          "D) Adverbial"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Subordinating conjunctions introduce dependent clauses, which cannot stand alone as complete sentences."

        "question": "Which pair is NOT an example of correlative coordinating conjunctions?",
        "type": "mcq",

        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Correlative conjunctions work in pairs.  'But' is a coordinating conjunction, but it doesn't pair with 'and' in a correlative structure."

          "D) Adverbial"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The conjunctions 'the more...the better' are correlative coordinating conjunctions, working in a pair to connect clauses."

      {
        "question": "The sentence 'Mary went to the store, and she bought milk' requires a comma before 'and' because:",
        "type": "mcq",

          "A) It joins two words",
          "B) It joins two dependent clauses",
          "C) It joins two independent clauses",
          "D) It is optional in this case"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The sentence contains two independent clauses that can stand alone. A comma is needed before the coordinating conjunction 'and' to separate them."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which of the following illustrates correct punctuation when using a coordinating conjunction to join multiple items?",
        "type": "mcq",

          "A) I like apples oranges and bananas",
          "B) I like apples, oranges and bananas",

          "D) I like apples, oranges and, bananas"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Commas separate items in a series; a comma is typically placed before the final conjunction."

        "question": "What is the acronym used to remember the coordinating conjunctions?",
        "type": "mcq",

          "A) FANBOYS",
          "B) SCABS",

          "D) SUBCONJ"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "FANBOYS is a common mnemonic device to remember the coordinating conjunctions: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So."
