      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a coordinating conjunction?",
        "options": [
          "and",
          "but",
          "because",
          "or"
        ],
        "answer": "because",
        "explanation": "Because is a subordinating conjunction, not a coordinating conjunction.  Coordinating conjunctions connect elements of equal grammatical rank; subordinating conjunctions introduce dependent clauses."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "A comma is always required before a coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "While a comma is usually required, it can be omitted if the independent clauses are very short."
      },
      {
        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "The acronym _______ is used to remember the coordinating conjunctions.",
        "answer": "FANBOYS",
        "explanation": "FANBOYS stands for For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So."
      },
      {
        "type": "stealth",
        "question": "Construct a sentence using the correlative conjunction 'both...and' to connect two phrases.",
        "answer": "Examples include: Both the teacher and the student understood the rules; Both her grammar and punctuation improved.",
        "explanation": "This question tests the understanding of how correlative conjunctions are used in sentence construction.  The answer should show correct usage to join elements of equal rank."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which conjunction pair is NOT a correlative coordinating conjunction as listed in the document?",
        "options": [
          "both...and",
          "neither...nor",
          "since...then",
          "either...or"
        ],
        "answer": "since...then",
        "explanation": "While 'since...then' might appear to show a relationship, it's not listed as a correlative coordinating conjunction in the provided text."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "Subordinating conjunctions connect independent clauses.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "Subordinating conjunctions connect dependent clauses to independent clauses."
      },
      {
        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "Subordinating conjunctions introduce a __________ clause.",
        "answer": "dependent",
        "explanation": "This highlights the key function of subordinating conjunctions."
      },
      {
        "type": "intelligence",
        "question": "Explain the difference between coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, providing an example of each in a sentence.",
        "answer": "Coordinating conjunctions join elements of equal grammatical rank (e.g., independent clauses, phrases, words). Example:  Mary studied hard, and she passed the test. Subordinating conjunctions join a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing the relationship between them. Example: Because she studied hard, Mary passed the test.",
        "explanation": "This assesses a comprehensive understanding of the differences and functions of both conjunction types, demonstrating knowledge beyond simple memorization."
