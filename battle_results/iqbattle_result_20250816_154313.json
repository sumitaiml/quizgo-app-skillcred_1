          "since",
          "and"
        ],
        "answer": "since",
        "explanation": "FANBOYS (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So) are the coordinating conjunctions. 'Since' is a subordinating conjunction."

        "answer": "Coordinating conjunctions connect words, phrases, or clauses of equal grammatical rank (e.g., independent clauses). Examples include 'and', 'but', 'or'.  Subordinating conjunctions connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing the relationship between them.  Examples include 'because', 'although', 'since'.  Example: Coordinating -  She studied hard, and she passed the exam. Subordinating - Because she studied hard, she passed the exam.",

        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Describe the punctuation rules when using coordinating conjunctions to join multiple words, phrases, or clauses.  Give examples.",
        "answer": "When joining two words, phrases, or subordinate clauses, no comma is needed. When joining more than two, use a comma between each item in the series; a comma before the final conjunction is optional. Example:  She ate apples, bananas, and oranges.  She ate apples, bananas, and oranges.",

        "answer": "Conjunctions allow writers to combine multiple ideas into a single sentence, creating more concise and varied sentence structures instead of using multiple short sentences. This improves readability and flow.",
