        "type": "mcq",
        "options": [
          "A) To directly interact with the user and ignore hardware",
          "B) To act as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware",
          "C) To solely manage application programs",
          "D) To only execute user programs"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The notes explicitly state the OS acts as an intermediary between the user and the hardware."

          "A) Execute user programs",
          "B) Maximize hardware complexity",

          "D) Use computer hardware efficiently"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The stated goals focus on user convenience and efficient hardware utilization, not maximizing complexity."

          "A) A set of programs used to interact with application programs",
          "B) The program running at all times, interacting with hardware",

          "A) To manage system resources for multiple users equally",
          "B) To allow multiple users to concurrently access and share resources",
          "C) To allow a single user to maximize resource utilization",
          "D) To minimize user interaction with the system"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The notes highlight the user view's focus on single-user resource monopolization for efficient work."
