          "and",
          "but",
          "because",
          "or"
        ],
        "answer": "because",
        "explanation": "Because is a subordinating conjunction, connecting a dependent clause to an independent clause."
      },

        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "A comma is always required before a coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "While generally true, commas can be omitted if the independent clauses are very short."

        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Explain the difference between coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, providing at least one example of each and illustrating their function in a sentence.",
        "explanation": "Coordinating conjunctions join words, phrases, or clauses of equal grammatical rank (e.g., 'Mary went to the store, and John stayed home'). Subordinating conjunctions join a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing the relationship between them (e.g., 'Because it was raining, Mary stayed home')."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pair is NOT a correlative coordinating conjunction?",

          "if...then",
          "neither...nor"
        ],
        "answer": "if...then",
        "explanation": "While 'if...then' indicates a conditional relationship, it's not considered a correlative coordinating conjunction as defined in the text."

      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "When joining three or more items in a series with coordinating conjunctions, a comma is always necessary before the final conjunction.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "The comma before the final conjunction is optional in a series of three or more items."
      },
      {
        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "Subordinating conjunctions connect a dependent clause to an _____________ clause.",
        "answer": "independent",
        "explanation": "This defines the fundamental function of subordinating conjunctions."
      },
      {
        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Provide three different examples illustrating the use of commas with coordinating conjunctions in sentences using different combinations of words, phrases, and clauses.",
        "explanation": "Answers should demonstrate correct comma usage when joining two independent clauses, and in series of words/phrases/subordinate clauses. Examples should show understanding of the rules outlined in the text, illustrating the correct and incorrect use of commas."
