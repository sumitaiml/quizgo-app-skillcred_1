        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a coordinating conjunction?",
        "options": [
          "and",
          "but",
          "because",
          "or"
        ],
        "answer": "because",
        "explanation": "FANBOYS (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) are the coordinating conjunctions.  'Because' is a subordinating conjunction."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "A comma is always required before a coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "While usually required, a comma can be omitted if the independent clauses are very short."
      },

        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "The acronym ______ is used to remember the coordinating conjunctions.",
        "answer": "FANBOYS",

        "question": "Identify the correlative conjunctions in the following sentence:  'Not only did she study hard, but also she sought help from the Writing Center.'",
        "answer": "Not only...but also",
        "explanation": "Correlative conjunctions work in pairs.  'Not only' and 'but also' are a common pair."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of conjunction connects a dependent clause to an independent clause?",
        "options": [
          "Coordinating",
          "Correlative",
          "Subordinating",
          "Adverbial"
        ],
        "answer": "Subordinating",
        "explanation": "Subordinating conjunctions introduce dependent clauses, showing their relationship to the main clause."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "When joining three or more words with a coordinating conjunction, commas are only necessary between the final two.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "Commas are used between each item in a series of three or more; the comma before the final conjunction is optional."
      },

        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "The sentence 'Mary went to the Writing Center, and John went home' illustrates the use of a comma before a coordinating conjunction joining ________ clauses.",
        "answer": "independent",
        "explanation": "The sentence contains two independent clauses joined by 'and'."
      },
      {
        "type": "intelligence",
        "question": "Explain the difference between coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, providing at least one example of each.",
        "answer": "Coordinating conjunctions (like 'and', 'but', 'or') join elements of equal grammatical rank (words, phrases, or independent clauses).  Subordinating conjunctions (like 'because', 'although', 'since') join a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing a relationship of dependence.",
        "explanation": "The answer requires understanding of the functional difference between the two types of conjunctions and the ability to provide suitable examples."
