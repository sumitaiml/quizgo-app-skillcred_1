        "explanation": "Construct the precedence graph.  T1->T2 (w2(x) before w1(x)), T1->T2 (r1(y) before w2(x) and r1(y) before r2(y)).  No cycles, therefore it is conflict-serializable."

        "explanation": "No. View equivalence considers the final state of the database. While both schedules result in the same final state for the given transactions, they are not view equivalent because they produce different intermediate states, thus having differing reads in the schedules"

        "question": "Is schedule S2: r1(x), r2(x), r2(y), w2(y), r1(y), w1(x) conflict-serializable?",
        "explanation": "Precedence graph: T2 -> T1 (r2(y) before w1(x)). T1 -> T2 (r1(x) before r2(x) and w1(x) before r2(x)). Cycle T1->T2->T1; therefore, not conflict-serializable."

      {
        "type": "Intelligence Report",
        "question": "Explain the difference between conflict serializability and view serializability.",
        "explanation": "Conflict serializability checks for cycles in the precedence graph based on conflicting operations. View serializability checks if a schedule is equivalent to some serial schedule based on the final state of the database, regardless of intermediate states.  A schedule can be view serializable but not conflict serializable."
