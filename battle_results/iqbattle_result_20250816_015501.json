          "but",
          "or",
          "because",
          "and"
        ],
        "answer": "because",
        "explanation": "FANBOYS (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) are the coordinating conjunctions.  'Because' is a subordinating conjunction."

        "question": "A comma is always required before a coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses.",

        "question": "Explain the difference between coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, providing at least one example of each and illustrating their function in a sentence.",
        "answer": "Coordinating conjunctions join words, phrases, or clauses of equal grammatical rank.  For example, in 'Mary went to the store, and John stayed home,' 'and' connects two independent clauses. Subordinating conjunctions join a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing the relationship between them.  For example, in 'Because it was raining, Mary stayed home,' 'because' introduces a dependent clause explaining why Mary stayed home."
