      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a coordinating conjunction?",
        "options": [
          "and",
          "but",
          "because",
          "or"
        ],
        "answer": "because",
        "explanation": "FANBOYS (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) are the coordinating conjunctions.  'Because' is a subordinating conjunction."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "A comma is always required before a coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "A comma is generally required, but can be omitted if the independent clauses are very short."
      },
      {
        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "The conjunctions 'both...and' are an example of _______________ coordinating conjunctions.",
        "answer": "correlative",
        "explanation": "Correlative conjunctions work in pairs to connect elements of equal grammatical rank."
      },
      {
        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Explain the difference between coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, providing at least one example of each and illustrating their function within a sentence.",
        "answer": "Coordinating conjunctions join elements of equal grammatical rank (words, phrases, or independent clauses). Example: 'Mary went to the store, and John stayed home.'  Subordinating conjunctions join a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing a relationship between them. Example: 'Because it was raining, Mary stayed home.'",
        "explanation": "The answer should clearly demonstrate understanding of the distinct roles of each type of conjunction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which correlative conjunction pair correctly completes the sentence:  _____  it rained, _____ we went for a walk.",
        "options": [
          "Although...yet",
          "Despite...still",
          "Because...therefore",
          "Either...or"
        ],
        "answer": "Although...yet",
        "explanation": "Although introduces a dependent clause expressing contrast, and 'yet' shows contrast within the independent clause."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "When using a coordinating conjunction to join more than two items in a series, commas are unnecessary.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "Commas are used between each item in a series, and a comma may or may not precede the final coordinating conjunction."
      },
      {
        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "Subordinating conjunctions introduce _____________ clauses.",
        "answer": "dependent",
        "explanation": "Dependent clauses cannot stand alone as complete sentences."
      },
      {
        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Provide a sentence using a subordinating conjunction that demonstrates a causal relationship between two clauses.",
        "answer": "Since it was a beautiful day, we decided to have a picnic.",
        "explanation": "The answer should use a subordinating conjunction that clearly establishes cause and effect.  Many correct answers exist."
