        "options": [
          "and",
          "but",
          "because",
          "or"
        ],
        "answer": "because",
        "explanation": "Because is a subordinating conjunction, connecting a dependent clause to an independent clause."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "A comma is always required before a coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "A comma is usually required, but it can be omitted if the clauses are very short."
      },
      {
        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "The acronym FANBOYS is used to remember the ________ conjunctions.",

        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Explain the difference between coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, providing examples of each and illustrating their function in sentences.",
        "answer": "Coordinating conjunctions join elements of equal grammatical rank (words, phrases, or clauses), while subordinating conjunctions connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing the relationship between them.  Examples: Coordinating:  Mary went to the store, and John stayed home. Subordinating: Because it was raining, Mary stayed home.",
        "explanation": "A complete and accurate answer should distinguish between the types and provide clear examples."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pair is NOT an example of correlative coordinating conjunctions?",
        "options": [
          "both...and",
          "either...or",
          "when...then",
          "neither...nor"
        ],
        "answer": "when...then",
        "explanation": "While 'when...then' shows a relationship, it doesn't fit the definition of correlative coordinating conjunctions as presented in the text."
      },
      {
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "Subordinating conjunctions introduce independent clauses.",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "Subordinating conjunctions introduce dependent clauses."
      },
      {
        "type": "fill_blank",
        "question": "When joining three or more items in a series, a comma is used between each item; a comma may or may not be used before the final ________.",
        "answer": "conjunction",
        "explanation": "This addresses the punctuation rules for coordinating conjunctions in series."
      },
      {
        "type": "essay",
        "question": "Describe a situation where using a coordinating conjunction would improve the clarity and flow of a sentence.  Provide an example sentence before and after the improvement.",
        "answer": "Example: Before: Mary wrote an essay. She handed it in. After: Mary wrote an essay and handed it in. Using 'and' combines two short sentences to create a single smoother sentence.  Other suitable examples could use other coordinating conjunctions to illustrate a variety of sentence improvements.",
        "explanation": "The answer should accurately show the use of coordinating conjunctions to improve sentence structure and flow."
